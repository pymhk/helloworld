## Abstract Title
Container Insights using OpenTelemetry: An open source observability framework 

## Abstract Content
OpenTelemetry (also referred to as OTel) is one of most popular open source community initiatives focusing on observability made up of a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. It’s a robust, portable telemetry for cloud-native software used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help understand your software’s performance and behavior. 
A large group of OpenTelemetry users are building modernized and distributed applications based on a microservices-based architecture, running on managed AWS containers and serverless services today. In this session we will showcase how you can leverage OpenTelemetry with one of our serverless AWS container services — AWS App Runner as an example to help provide customers with a robust tracing capability for their containerized web applications. It will include scenarios such as request sampling, OTel collector resource consumption control, cost effective, auto-scaling, and other customization capabilities. We will dive deep into how it helps containerized platform users to easily understand the health of their application. So, come and learn how Open Telemetry can help if your applications are impacted by performance bottlenecks or increased error rates, thus, solving a variety of operational challenges to transform your business.
